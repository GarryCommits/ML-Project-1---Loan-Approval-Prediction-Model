To build a prediction model for banking loan approval for a nationalized bank, we collected and preprocessed applicant data including credit score, employment type, income, age, and other attributes. Missing values were imputed using median and mode strategies, and categorical variables were encoded. Due to class imbalance (more rejected loans than approved), we applied SMOTE to balance the dataset. We trained a Random Forest Classifier, which achieved 64.5% accuracy with improved precision and recall for both approved and rejected classes. The model helps in identifying potentially eligible loan applicants, improving decision-making and reducing risk.
